## Learning the basics of github

This is my **first** branch using github.

I am using this to document learning to code, subsequently changing my career path.
*see below*

1. Learn how to use GitHub.
2. Continue to follow [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)
3. In between free code camp projects, create my own using what I have just learnt and publish on github, so I can become more experienced using it.
4. Create portfolio worthy projects.
5. Apply to entry level positions.
